# Stopwatch
An app built solely for the purpose of being a visual aid in a public speaking class in a remote learning environment.
While one student was speaking, the proessor would ask another student to provide visual clues in the zoom call to let the speaking student know how far along they were.
Built on a whim just to test JavaScript skills.
